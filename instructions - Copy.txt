OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY raw HTML code. No explanations. First line must be <!DOCTYPE html>

You are an intelligence analyst creating a comprehensive executive-level brief. Read messages_processed.json.



STRICT REQUIREMENTS:

DON'T FUCKING EDIT MY SCRIPT AT ALL process_messages.py don't fuck with it!!! 

1. TIME WINDOW
   - Extract from metadata.time_window in the JSON
   - State as "Reporting Period: [start] to [end] UTC"

Create an intelligence executive brief using the provided data. Follow these specifications exactly:

**Structure Requirements:**

1. Key Highlights: Create a top section organized by major theme headers. Under each theme header, use bullet points listing only the most critical facts and developments. Each bullet point must be a single line or short statement.
2. Detailed Analysis: Follow with sections organized by theme. Each theme gets its own section with a header.
3. Use clear hierarchy: Strategic developments before tactical details, high-confidence information before speculation.

**Content Requirements:**

1. Remove all duplicate information. If the same fact appears multiple times with different timestamps, use it once with the earliest timestamp.
2. Consolidate related statistics into single statements.
3. Eliminate redundant attributions. State "Source reports that..." once per paragraph, not after every sentence.
4. Mark speculation explicitly with the word "Speculative" or "Estimated" when sources use conditional language like "could," "may," or "reportedly planning."
5. Include all substantive information from the source data. Omit only redundant repetitions and purely stylistic filler.

**Formatting Requirements:**

1. Key Highlights section: Use theme headers in bold followed by bullet points. Keep bullet points to one line or short statement each.
2. Detailed Analysis sections: Write in short paragraphs. Break content into multiple paragraphs rather than creating long blocks of text.
3. Place all timestamps as footnote-style references at the end of each major section, not inline.
4. Use active voice. Avoid phrases like "was reported," "is said to have."
5. Present facts without editorial commentary on their significance unless directly stated by sources.
6. Write concisely without imposing arbitrary length restrictions.

**Prohibited:**

- Do not repeat any fact, statistic, or quote
- Do not include content unrelated to the section header
- Do not use vague attribution when specific sources exist
- Do not provide tactical military details unless they indicate strategic intent
- Do not create long paragraphs in the Detailed Analysis section

CRITICAL: This is COMPREHENSIVE intelligence analysis. Cover everything of geopolitical significance. Synthesize, contextualize, connect dots. Be thorough, not selective.

Output ONLY the HTML file to brief.html DO NOT OUTPUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. ONLY THE REPORT!

DO NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING LIKE THE FOLLOWING IN THE brief.html file 

I have created the `brief.html` file as requested, containing the comprehensive intelligence analysis based on the provided JSON data. The report covers the required time window, includes an executive summary, a detailed thematic analysis with in-text citations, and a final list of sources, all formatted with professional CSS. The content synthesizes all substantive geopolitical information from the messages while adhering to all specified formatting and length requirements. max-width: 1200px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 40px; background-color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #ddd; box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.05); } h1, h2 { font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 1.5em; } h1 { font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.5em; } h2 { font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 1em; } p, li { font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em; } .meta-info { text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 2em; font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; } .citation { font-size: 0.9em; color: #888; font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif; font-style: italic; } .source-list { list-style-type: square; padding-left: 20px; }
